# INST126-Final-Project: To-Do List

**Purpose**

This python program is a command-line to-do list that incorporates various features that allow users to interactively add tasks and analyzie the to-do list using a DataFrame. The progam uses different packages, such as numpy and pandas for vectorized computation and data manipulation. Users are able to add tasks to their to-do list!


**Features**
- Add Tasks: Users can add tasks to the to-do list interactively.
- String Manipulation: Utilizes string methods, backslashes to escape special characters, and raw strings to enhance string manipulation.
- Regular Expressions: Checks task patterns and extracts information from tasks using regular expressions with groupings.
- Vectorized Computations: Uses NumPy to perform vectorized computations on the to-do list DataFrame.
- Pandas DataFrames: Reads data from and writes data to CSV files using Pandas DataFrames.


**Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Re


**Getting Started**
1. In order to get the complete project on your local machine, clone the repository using the code below:

  "git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-data-generator.git"

2. To use the necessary packages, which include numpy, pandas, and re, use the following code in the terminal of editor to install packages

  "pip install numpy, pandas, re"

**Note**: if packages are not working or errors, such as "reportMissingModuleSource" or "reportMissingImports", try opening the anaconda prompt and typing "conda install 'FILL IN PACKAGE NAME HERE'".

3. Run program
 
4. Follow user prompts
  
5. Write your own to-do list!
